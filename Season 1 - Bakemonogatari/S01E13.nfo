Koyomi goes to the school bike rack and gets a text from Tsubasa, asking him to ditch school and come to the playground. He finds her there still in her pajamas and wearing a hat. They begin talking about her recent headaches and Koyomi persuades her to take her hat off. He finds out that she had grown cat ears. They agree to go to Oshino’s place. When they reach there, they find him crouching down, buring something in the dirt. Oshino asks them to come in and hits the side of Tsubasa’s head, knocking her out.
